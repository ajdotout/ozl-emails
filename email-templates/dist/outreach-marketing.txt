LET'S ACCELERATE YOUR OZ PROJECT

Hi Abraham, I noticed your Opportunity Zone project at 2361 2nd Avenue in East Harlem, New York.

I think you're doing your fundraising wrong.

But first, let me introduce myself. I'm Todd Vitzthum, founder of OZListings—the premier AI-powered marketplace for Opportunity Zone investments. We connect developers like you with qualified investors actively seeking OZ deals, streamline your capital raise process, and provide comprehensive deal marketing services that get your project in front of the right people.

Because we recognize smart developers when we see them—and we think you're one of them—we're offering a complimentary strategy call for a limited time. Let's discuss how we can accelerate your capital raise and connect you with the right investors.

Spots are filling fast—only a few complimentary calls remaining this month.
